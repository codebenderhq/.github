## Hi there 👋

Welcome to a collection of some of the most notable and impactful moments in internet history.

Over the past decade, the internet has served as a platform for countless individuals and organizations to express themselves, connect with others, and effect positive change. Its potential for facilitating freedom and liberation is truly remarkable, with opportunities ranging from education and innovation to social activism and political reform.

Despite these challenges, the internet remains a powerful tool that can be harnessed for good. By leveraging the opportunities it provides, we can work towards a more equitable, just, and connected world, where freedom and liberation are accessible to all.
